<h3> AFCM 25th Anniversary Celebration Concert <br> by Helen Land</h3>

<p>A very pleasant Sunday afternoon in Queens Gardens was attended by approximately three and half thousand satisfied
    music lovers. This free concert organised to celebrate the 25th Anniversary of the AFCM was also a fitting
    opportunity for BRO to celebrate its 15th Anniversary with it’s first ever outdoor public performance. </p>

<p> The tastes of all music lovers was satiated. The concert opened with the ceremonial and pompous Brass composition by
    Aaron Copland titled Fanfare for the Common Man, followed by the equally ceremonial Imperial March by William
    Walton. Genuine fun and musical camaraderie emanated from the performance by Camerata of St Johns with their
    virtuosic classical performance. In addition they ably accompanied Amy Dickson in her flawless saxophone performance
    with her distinctive tone clearly displaying the reason she is sought after around the world. </p>

<p>1RAR Big Band played to the high standard Townsville audiences are familiar. They had the audience tapping their feet
    to their musical and vocal compositions. Cheryl Barker’s powerful soprano rang across the park and most likely was
    heard on Castle Hill as she sang two arias accompanied by BRO and conducted by UK conductor Nicholas Daniel. </p>

<p>The finale of the afternoon which included musicians from all three ensembles was the 1812 Overture. It was
    delightful to see the audience enthusiastically participate in this finale. This pleasant afternoon can only be
    rated as a huge success and may prove to be the first of many performances in years to come.</p>

<h2>President’s Report </h2>

<h3>For 2015 AGM North Queensland Ensembles Inc. </h3>

<p>The Barrier Reef Orchestra is in a sound financial position with concert attendance and revenue from tickets up for
    2013. </p>

<p>The Orchestra performed on six occasions over the last 12 months. This included a children’s concert at Riverway
    featuring music from Harry Potter and Peter and the Wolf. The concert was well received by the audience and the
    Orchestra got into the mood by dressing up appropriately for their musical characters</p>

<p>Masterworks conducted by Mark Sheills and featuring the 2013 Australian Concerto and Vocal Competition winner was
    performed in September with a follow up performance in the Burdekin. Sadly the Burdekin concert was not well
    attended despite the best efforts in advertising and extra signage. </p>

<p>Last Night of the Proms was performed in November and conducted by Richard McIntyre. As expected the audience join in
    with the antics. </p>

<p>The New Year saw the successful season launch at the Pier Restaurant and featured our new harp much to the enjoyment
    of those present. The Mayor of Townsville, Councillor Jenny Hill, officially launched the 2015 season and spoke of
    the importance of the Barrier Reef Orchestra to Townsville. Not long after that was Sounds of Romance conducted by
    Raymond Yong. The issue of parking problems were extreme and the matter was taken up with Council. Hopefully there
    will not be a repeat performance. </p>

<p>The Orchestra was invited to open the Townsville Arts Awards with a cameo performance of the music from Frozen much
    to the audiences’ pleasure, particularly with the AV accompaniment. The Barrier Reef Orchestra will conduct the
    second Conducting Workshop at the end of May as it was so successful in 2013. </p>

<p>For the rest of the year there is our support to the AFCM concert, our World Music Concert commissioned by the Civic
    Theatre (a first for BRO), support to DanceNorth with their Twilight performances and lastly a Musical Feast for
    November. </p>

<p>To make all of this happen there is a dynamic and committed committee working away to bring this all together. I
    thank them all for their magnificent work. My thanks also goes to our major sponsor the Townsville City Council, our
    generous benefactors and to the Orchestra Manager Sally Frewen-Lord who has found time to run a survey for the
    musicians to get some feedback on how we do business. Thank you all. </p>

<p>Jeff Nielsen has reworked our website and taken great steps forward in producing a functional and relevant website.
    Jeff is handing it over to the next person to continue the good work, Thanks Jeff. I will be introducing life
    members later as a way of marking the Barrier Reef Orchestra 15th Anniversary. </p>

<p> The Barrier Reef Orchestra has taken the opportunity to be directly involved with the development of the TPAC
    proposal. I see it as necessary support to all of the arts organisations to promote the need for more performance
    spaces in Townsville and I would urge you all to visit the website and help spread the word. Simon has injected
    himself into this project with the usual eye for detail while keeping appraised of the macro developments in
    Townsville. Thanks Simon for your energy and incisive views on this important project. </p>

<p>The 15th anniversary year of BRO has been marked by several approaches to the Orchestra to perform in support of
    other arts organisations. I take this as a sign of confidence others see in our Orchestra and acceptance of the
    Barrier Reef Orchestra as Townsville’s resident cultural cornerstone to orchestral music. A fitting milestone for
    the 15th year of the Barrier Reef Orchestra. </p>
