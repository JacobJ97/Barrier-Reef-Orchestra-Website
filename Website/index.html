<h1> The Barrier Reef Orchestra - A North Queensland Icon</h1>

<p> Fast becoming one of North Queensland’s cultural jewels, the Barrier Reef Orchestra launches into it's 15th year of performing orchestral music throughout North Queensland! A community orchestra consisting of the finest musicians drawn from as far away as Cairns and Mackay, it focuses on unique orchestral juxtapositions. If you would like to become a member of our orchestral group, then print, fill out and send us this <a href="documentation/application-form-web.pdf">application form.</a></p>

<p>An outstanding performance of Beethoven’s 9th Symphony that was presented to a sell-out audience, was recently followed by Peter Sculthorpe’s Mangroves, a collaboration with audio-visual artists, ABC radio and Umbrella Studios. The programs are a testament to the orchestra’s willingness to embrace mainstream classical repertoire as well as opportunities for collaboration. </p>

<p>In 2015 the orchestra has been invited to perform in three festivals, and features in the Townsville Civic Theatre season. This is a first for the orchestra - underscoring its value to the community and highlighting its continued prominence in the cultural soundscape of North Queensland. </p>

<p>The next performance in 2015, named "A Musical Feast", features an array of music from many different composers, including Bach, Brahms and Strauss. Click <a href="https://au.patronbase.com/_TVCC/Productions/0886/Performances">here</a> to buy tickets now!</p>
